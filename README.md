# Tips

### 16. Apply `HitTestBehavior.opaque` on GestureDetector to make the entire size of the gesture detector a hit region
If your GestureDetector isn't picking up gestures in a transparent/translucent widget, make sure to set its behavior to `HitTestBehavior.opaque` so it'll capture those events.
```dart
GestureDetector(
  behavior: HitTestBehavior.opaque,
  onTap: ()=>print('Tap!'),
  child: Container(
  height: 250,
  width: 250,
  child: Center(child: Text('Gesture Test')),
 ),
),
```
`Opaque` targets can be hit by hit tests, causing them to both receive events within their bounds and prevent targets visually behind them from also receiving events.

### 15. Check if release mode or not
You can use `kReleaseMode` constant to check if the code is running in release mode or not.
`kReleaseMode` is a top-level constant from `foundation.dart`. 

More specifically, this is a constant that is true if the application was compiled in Dart with the '-Ddart.vm.product=true' flag. (from https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/kReleaseMode-constant.html)

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

print('Is Release Mode: $kReleaseMode');
```

### 14. Set background image to your Container.

Want to set the background image to your Container? And you are using a Stack to do so?
There is a better way to achieve this result.
You can use decoration to set the image in the container.

```dart
Container(
  width: double.maxFinite,
  height: double.maxFinite,
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    image: DecorationImage(
      image: NetworkImage('https://bit.ly/2oqNqj9'),
    ),
  ),
  child: Center(
    child: Text(
      'Flutter.dev',
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red),
    ),
  ),
),

```

You can provide Image according to your need, also you can use the box decoration properties to provide shape and border.

### 13. Prefer single quotes for strings
Use double quotes for nested strings or (optionally) for strings that contain single quotes. For all other strings, use single quotes.

```dart
final String name = 'Flutter And Dart Tips';

print('Hello ${name.split(" ")[0]}');
print('Hello ${name.split(" ")[2]}');

```

### 12. Implement `assert()` messages in Dart.

Do you know that you can throw your message when your `assert` fails?
`assert()` takes an optional message in which you can pass your message.

```dart
assert(title != null, "Title string cannot be null.");
```

### 11. Using Plurals in your Dart String.

**Plurals:** Different languages have different rules for grammatical agreement with quantity. In English, for example, the quantity 1 is a special case. We write "1 book", but for any other quantity we'd write "n books". This distinction between singular and plural is very common, but other languages make finer distinctions.

You can use Plurals in your Dart string by using [`Intl`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package. The full set supported by `Intl` package is zero, one, two, few, many, and other.

- Add dependency:

```yaml
dependencies:
  intl: version
```

- How to use:

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';
...
notificationCount(int howMany) => Intl.plural(
      howMany,
      zero: 'You don\'t have any notification.',
      one: 'You have $howMany notification.',
      other: 'You have $howMany notifications.',
      name: "notification",
      args: [howMany],
      examples: const {'howMany': 42},
      desc: "How many notifications are there.",
    );

    print(notificationCount(0));
    print(notificationCount(1));
    print(notificationCount(2));
    
```

- Output:

```Output
You don't have any notification.
You have 1 notification.
There are 2 notifications.
```

### 10. Having trouble displaying splashes using an InkWell?
Use an Ink widget! The Ink widget draws on the same widget that InkWell does, so the splash appears.

```dart
class InkWellCard extends StatelessWidget {
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      elevation: 3.0,
      child: Ink(
        child: InkWell(
          child: Center(
            child: Text("Order Bagels"),
          ),
          onTap: () => print("Ordering.."),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```


### 9. Want to log data on the system console in Flutter?

You can use the `print()` function to view it in the system console.
If your output is too much, then Android sometimes discards some log lines.
To avoid this, you can use `debugPrint()`.

You can also log your print calls to disk if you're doing long-term or background work.

### 8. Cascade Notation - Method Chaining on Steroids :pill::syringe:
`Cascades Notation (..)` allows chaining a sequence of operations on the same object. Besides, fields (data-members) can be accessed using the same.

[Open in DartPad :dart:](https://dartpad.dartlang.org/a93316aa779a2e0dd1993ae9a3464731)

```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;
  Person(this.name, this.age);
  void data() => print("$name is $age years old.");
}

void main() {
   // Without Cascade Notation
   Person person = Person("Richard", 50);
   person.data();
   person.age = 22;
   person.data();
   person.name += " Parker";
   person.data();
   
   // Cascade Notation with Object of Person
   Person("Jian", 21)
    ..data()
    ..age = 22
    ..data()
    ..name += " Yang"
    ..data();
    
   // Cascade Notation with List
   List<String>()
    ..addAll(["Natasha", "Steve", "Peter", "Tony"])
    ..sort()
    ..forEach((name) => print("\n$name"));
}
```

### 7. Want to set different Theme for a particular widget?

Just wrap the widget with the `Theme` Widget and pass the `ThemeData()`.

```dart
Theme(
  data: ThemeData(...),
  child: TextFormField(
    decoration: const InputDecoration(
      icon: Icon(Icons.person),
      hintText: 'What do people call you?',
      labelText: 'Name *',
    ),
    onSaved: (String value) {
      // This optional block of code can be used to run
      // code when the user saves the form.
    },
    validator: (String value) {
      return value.contains('@')
        ? 'Do not use the @ char'
        : null;
    }
  ),
)
```

### 6. Use a Ternary operator instead of the if-else to shorter your Dart code.

Use below.

```dart
void main() {
  bool isAndroid = true;
  getDeviceType() => isAndroid ? "Android" : "Other";
  print("Device Type: " + getDeviceType());
}
```

Instead of this.

```dart
void main() {
  bool isAndroid;
  getDeviceType() {
    if (isAndroid) {
      return "Android";
    } else {
      return "Other";
    }
  }
  print("Device Type: " + getDeviceType());
}
```

### 5. Want to run a task periodically in Dart?

What about using `Timer.periodic`
It will create a repeating timer, It will take a two-argument one is `duration` and the second is `callback` that must take a one Timer parameter.

```dart
Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 2), (Timer time) {
  print("Flutter");
});
```

You can cancel the timer using the `timer.cancel()`.

### 4. Apply style as a Theme in a `Text`Â widget.
Check out the below article for detail information about this tip.
[Apply style as a Theme in a `Text`Â widget](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-apply-style-as-a-theme-in-a-text-widget-90268328bd23)

```dart
Text(
  "Your Text",
  style: Theme.of(context).textTheme.title,
),
```

### 3. Do not explicitly initialize variables to `null`.

Adding `= null` is redundant and unneeded.

```dart
// Good
var title;

// Bad
var title = null;
```

### 2. Using `ListView.separated()`
Want to add the separator in your Flutter ListView?

Go for the
`ListView.separated();`

The best part about separated is it can be any widget.ðŸ˜ƒ

Check out the below image for the sample code.

```dart
ListView.seperated(
  seperatorBuilder: (context, index) => Divider(),
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) => new ExampleNameItem(
    exampleNames: names[index],
  ),
  itemCount: names.length,
  padding: new EdgeInsets.symetric(
    vertical: 8.0,
    horizontal: 8.0,
  ),
);
```

### 1. Using `null-aware operators`
While checking the null in the Dart, Use `null-aware operators` help you reduce the amount of code required to work with references that are potentially null.

```dart
// User below

title ??= "Title";

// instead of

if (title == null) {
  title = "Title";
}
```
