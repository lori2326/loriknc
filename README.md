### 14. Set background image to your Container.

Want to set the background image to your Container? And you are using a Stack to do so?
There is a better way achieve this result.
You can use decoration to set the image in the container.

```Dart
Container(
  width: double.maxFinite,
  height: double.maxFinite,
  decoration: BoxDecoration(
    image: DecorationImage(
      image: NetworkImage('https://bit.ly/2oqNqj9'),
    ),
  ),
  child: Center(
    child: Text(
      'Flutter.dev',
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.red),
    ),
  ),
),

```

You can provide Image according to your need, also you can use the box decoration properties to provide a shape and border.


### 13. Prefer single quotes for strings
Use double quotes for nested strings or (optionally) for strings that contain single quotes. For all other strings, use single quotes.

```Dart
final String name = 'Flutter And Dart Tips';

print('Hello ${name.split(" ")[0]}');
print('Hello ${name.split(" ")[2]}');

```

### 12. Implement `assert()` messages in Dart.

Do you know that you can throw your own message when your `assert` fails?
`assert()` takes an optional message in which you can pass your message.

```Dart
assert(title != null, "Title string cannot be null.");
```

### 11. Using Plurals in your Dart String.

**Plurals:** Different languages have different rules for grammatical agreement with quantity. In English, for example, the quantity 1 is a special case. We write "1 book", but for any other quantity we'd write "n books". This distinction between singular and plural is very common, but other languages make finer distinctions.

You can use Plurals in your Dart string by using [`Intl`](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package. The full set supported by `Intl` package is zero, one, two, few, many, and other.

- Add dependency:

```Dart
dependencies:
  intl: version
```

- How to use:

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';
...
notificationCount(int howMany) => Intl.plural(
      howMany,
      zero: 'You don\'t have any notification.',
      one: 'You have $howMany notification.',
      other: 'You have $howMany notifications.',
      name: "notification",
      args: [howMany],
      examples: const {'howMany': 42},
      desc: "How many notifications are there.",
    );

    print(notificationCount(0));
    print(notificationCount(1));
    print(notificationCount(2));
    
```

- Output:

```Outout
You don't have any notification.
You have 1 notification.
There are 2 notifications.
```

### 10. Having trouble displaying splashes using an InkWell?
Use an Ink widget! The Ink widget draws on the same widget that InkWell does, so the splash appears.

### 9. Want to log data on the system console in Flutter?

You can use the `print()` function to view it in the system console.
If your output is too much, then Android sometimes discards some log lines.
To avoid this, you can use `debugPrint()`.

You can also log your print calls to disk if your doing long-term or background work.

### 8. Cascade Notation - Method Chaining on Steroids :pill::syringe:
`Cascades Notation (..)` allows to chain a sequence of operations on same object. In addition, fields (data-memebers) can be accessed using the same.
